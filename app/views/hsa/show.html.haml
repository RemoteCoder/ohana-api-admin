    If there are any keywords, short phrases,
    or abbreviations (like CPS!) that aren't already captured in the current
    keywords list or the categories checkboxes, please add them in one of the boxes
    under the Keywords section. Please don't feel obligated to fill them out. It's fine
    to leave them blank.
    There are also checkboxes for each category based on the Open Eligibility terms
    we showed you on Tuesday. Please check at least one that accurately describes the services provided by the organization, then click on
    "Update location". Thank you!
