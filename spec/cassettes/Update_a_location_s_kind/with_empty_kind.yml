        Animal Licensing is operated under contract PetData, Inc., a Texas-based company,
        to administer licensing for animals that reside within the County. All dogs
        that reside within the County must have annual rabies vaccinations and be
        licensed. While vaccinations and licensing is suggested for all cats residing
        in the County, it is required in the City of Belmont, City of San Mateo, and
        all unincorporated areas of the County.  Proper licensing is essential to
        ensure compliance with rabies vaccination, reduce the potential for a rabies
        outbreak in San Mateo County, increase the likelihood of finding an aggressive
        animal or an animal that has bitten, and reduce the number of people who must
        receive post-exposure rabies vaccine after a bite. To find out if your pet
        is licensed or to update your pet''s information, please contact PetData,

        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves
        individuals who are not conserved, but who need assistance in managing their
        public benefits. In-Home Supportive Services provides assistance with personal
        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who
        are blind and disabled, and children who, without these services, would be
        unable to remain safely in their homes. Public Guardianship/Conservatorship,

        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding

        input, the committee assists in fundraising and educating consumers about
        nutrition issues. - The Housing Committee is a joint committee of the Commission

        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves

        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who
        are blind and disabled, and children who, without these services, would be
        unable to remain safely in their homes. Public Guardianship/Conservatorship,

        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding

        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves

        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who
        are blind and disabled, and children who, without these services, would be
        unable to remain safely in their homes. Public Guardianship/Conservatorship,

        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding

        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature

        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program

        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public

        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who

        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding

        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public

        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and

        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves
        individuals who are not conserved, but who need assistance in managing their
        public benefits. In-Home Supportive Services provides assistance with personal
        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who
        are blind and disabled, and children who, without these services, would be
        unable to remain safely in their homes. Public Guardianship/Conservatorship,
        appointed by and under the authority and direction of the Superior Court,
        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding
        for a variety of programs, advocates on behalf of older persons and provides
        long-range planning, coordination, and program development for programs and
        services for older adults. The New Beginning Coalition (650-573-3527) is a
        broad-based group of providers and consumers that works in partnership with
        Aging and Adult Services and other organizations to improve the quality of
        life of older persons and adults with disabilities. Other programs include
        the Commission on Aging and the Commission on Disabilities (described separately).","short_desc":"Provides

        the program is to keep hazardous wastes from entering landfills, drinking
        water, surface or groundwater sources. Items collected include latex and oil-based
        paint, paint thinners and solvents, motor oil, antifreeze, household cleaners,
        garden chemicals, hobby and pool products. There is a product reuse give-away
        program and a latex paint recycling program. The Used Oil Program is also
        operated by the Environmental Health Services Division.   Waste is collected
        from residents by appointment only. Residents can make an appointment online
        at www.smchealth.org/hhw or call the automated voice mail system at 650-363-4718.
        There are five permanent and six temporary collection locations in the county.  The
        Very Small Quantity Generator Program (VSQG) provides a cost effective disposal
        option for businesses that produce less than 27 gallons of hazardous waste
        per month. VSQG collection events are held twice a month. The Product Reuse
        Giveaway Program offers household waste products deemed reusable. These products
        are given away free to the public from the warehouse located in Redwood City.
        The warehouse is open the first and third Thursday from 3 to 4 pm. There are
        five latex paint collection locations throughout the county. This paint is
        sent to a paint manufacturer for reprocessing.  The Used Oil Program provides
        for safe disposal of used motor oil, oil filters and antifreeze. Call the

        Intake serves as the single point of entry to adult services within Aging
        and Adult Services and provides referrals to community-based social support
        programs.   Adult Protective Services is a function of Centralized Intake.
        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves
        individuals who are not conserved, but who need assistance in managing their
        public benefits. In-Home Supportive Services provides assistance with personal
        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who
        are blind and disabled, and children who, without these services, would be
        unable to remain safely in their homes. Public Guardianship/Conservatorship,
        appointed by and under the authority and direction of the Superior Court,
        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding
        for a variety of programs, advocates on behalf of older persons and provides
        long-range planning, coordination, and program development for programs and
        services for older adults. The New Beginning Coalition (650-573-3527) is a
        broad-based group of providers and consumers that works in partnership with

        programs.   Adult Protective Services is a function of Centralized Intake.
        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves
        individuals who are not conserved, but who need assistance in managing their
        public benefits. In-Home Supportive Services provides assistance with personal
        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who
        are blind and disabled, and children who, without these services, would be
        unable to remain safely in their homes. Public Guardianship/Conservatorship,
        appointed by and under the authority and direction of the Superior Court,
        assists frail elderly individuals and persons with substantial physical and/or
        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding
        for a variety of programs, advocates on behalf of older persons and provides
        long-range planning, coordination, and program development for programs and

        the Commission on Aging, as well as to participate on its standing committees.
        - The Community-based Continuum of Care serves as a planning, advocacy and
        information-sharing committee on a variety of long-term care programs designed
        to maximize the independence of older adults and adults with disabilities.
        - The Legislative/Advocacy Committee reviews pending legislation and advocates
        on behalf of older adults. - The Minority Elders Committee develops strategies
        and activities to increase effective communication, reduce barriers to specific
        services and enhance responsiveness of services to San Mateo County''s diverse
        population of older adults. - The Nutrition Committee provides a focal point
        for the discussion of nutrition-related issues. In addition to receiving consumer
        input, the committee assists in fundraising and educating consumers about
        nutrition issues. - The Housing Committee is a joint committee of the Commission
        on Aging and the Commission on Disabilities which promotes both affordable
        and accessible housing opportunities for older adults and people with disabilities.
        In addition to its standing committees, the Commission on Aging may establish
        ad hoc committees or task forces to address emergent issues not covered by
        its standing committees. It also establishes liaison relationships with a
        number other committees and task forces in the County that work on issues

        Animal Licensing is operated under contract PetData, Inc., a Texas-based company,
        to administer licensing for animals that reside within the County. All dogs
        that reside within the County must have annual rabies vaccinations and be
        licensed. While vaccinations and licensing is suggested for all cats residing
        in the County, it is required in the City of Belmont, City of San Mateo, and
        all unincorporated areas of the County.  Proper licensing is essential to
        ensure compliance with rabies vaccination, reduce the potential for a rabies
        outbreak in San Mateo County, increase the likelihood of finding an aggressive
        animal or an animal that has bitten, and reduce the number of people who must
        receive post-exposure rabies vaccine after a bite. To find out if your pet
        is licensed or to update your pet''s information, please contact PetData,

        The TIES Line, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, receives reports of suspected
        dependent adult and older adult abuse and neglect. The Centralized Intake
        Unit, which consists of a multi-disciplinary staff of social workers, public
        health nurses and deputy public guardians, conducts comprehensive assessments
        of the client and the allegations, provides information and referral, access
        and advocacy to county-operated and/or community-based programs as part of
        the service plan that is developed. Centralized Intake has a 24-Hour Response
        Program. A social worker receives telephone calls from the community, assesses
        the client-related matter over the telephone, makes a home visit if appropriate,
        and may provide short-term emergency protection such as shelter, food, or
        protective supervision until a long-term plan is developed by an assigned
        case manager. The Centralized Intake''s Representative Payee Program serves

        and domestic services for financially-eligible older adults, individuals who

        mental disabilities who are unable to provide for their own personal needs,
        manage their financial resources, or resist fraud and undue influence. Multipurpose
        Senior Services Program (MSSP) is a comprehensive case management program
        that serves persons age 65 or over who need nursing home level care and are
        currently eligible for Medi-Cal with no share of cost. The goal of the program
        is to arrange for and monitor the use of community services to prevent premature
        placement. The AIDS Case Management Program provides comprehensive home and
        community-based services to persons with AIDS or symptomatic HIV. The program
        uses an interdisciplinary core case management team consisting of a nurse
        case manager and a social work case manager working with the client to determine
        needed services. The Area Agency on Aging (650-573-2700) administers funding

        - The Legislative/Advocacy Committee reviews pending legislation and advocates
        on behalf of older adults. - The Minority Elders Committee develops strategies
        and activities to increase effective communication, reduce barriers to specific
        services and enhance responsiveness of services to San Mateo County''s diverse
        population of older adults. - The Nutrition Committee provides a focal point

        input, the committee assists in fundraising and educating consumers about
        nutrition issues. - The Housing Committee is a joint committee of the Commission
        on Aging and the Commission on Disabilities which promotes both affordable
        and accessible housing opportunities for older adults and people with disabilities.
